1. How Angular application runs?

In an Angular application, the process of bootstrapping is the initialization and execution of the application. It involves starting the Angular framework, loading the root module, and rendering the root component. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the Angular application runs and bootstraps:

Main Entry Point (main.ts):

The main entry point for an Angular application is typically the main.ts file. This file is responsible for importing the necessary modules and bootstrapping the Angular application.
typescript
Copy code
// main.ts

import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
In this example, platformBrowserDynamic() is used to create a platform for dynamically bootstrapping the application. It then calls bootstrapModule(AppModule) to bootstrap the main module of the application (AppModule in this case).
Main Module (AppModule):

The main module (AppModule) is a TypeScript class annotated with @NgModule. It specifies metadata about the application, such as the components, services, and other modules it includes.
typescript
Copy code
// app.module.ts

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
The bootstrap property in the @NgModule decorator indicates which component should be used as the root component of the application. In this case, it's the AppComponent.
Root Component (AppComponent):

The root component is the starting point for rendering the application. It is identified by the bootstrap property in the main module.
typescript
Copy code
// app.component.ts

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: '<h1>Hello, Angular!</h1>'
})
export class AppComponent { }
In this simple example, the AppComponent is a basic component with a template that includes an <h1> tag.
Rendering the Application:

The Angular framework now takes over, creating an instance of the root module (AppModule), which in turn creates an instance of the root component (AppComponent).
The template associated with the root component is rendered in the HTML file (usually index.html), replacing the element identified by the selector (<app-root> in this case).
Component Lifecycle Hooks:

Angular components have lifecycle hooks, such as ngOnInit, which can be used for initialization logic. These hooks allow developers to perform actions at specific points in the component lifecycle.
Dynamic Data Binding:

Angular uses two-way data binding to keep the view in sync with the underlying data. Changes to the data trigger updates in the view, and user interactions can update the data.
Event Handling:

Angular components can respond to user interactions through event handling. Actions like button clicks or form submissions trigger corresponding methods in the component.
Angular Router (Optional):

If the application uses Angular Router for navigation, the router dynamically updates the view based on the URL, loading the appropriate components and updating the UI without a full page reload.
In summary, the bootstrapping process in Angular involves starting from the main.ts file, creating an instance of the main module (AppModule), initializing the root component (AppComponent), and rendering the application in the browser. This process sets the foundation for the dynamic and interactive behavior of Angular applications.


2. Explain basic Angular Folder stuctures.

Angular is a front-end web application framework developed by Google. It's widely used for building dynamic, single-page applications. Let's go over the basic structure and important files in an Angular project:

src Folder:

app Folder: This is where the main application code resides.
app.component.ts: The root component of the application, defining the application logic and structure.
app.module.ts: The main module that orchestrates the different parts of the application, including components, services, and other modules.
app.component.html: The template file for the root component, defining the HTML structure of the component.
app.component.css: The styles specific to the root component.
assets Folder:

This folder contains static assets like images or JSON files that are used in the application.
environments Folder:

Contains environment-specific configuration files. Typically, you have environment.ts for development and environment.prod.ts for production.
index.html:

The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application. It includes the <app-root> tag, where the Angular application is bootstrapped.
main.ts:

The main entry point for the Angular application. It initializes the Angular platform and bootstraps the main module (AppModule by default).
angular.json:

Configuration file for Angular CLI. It includes settings for build and development processes, such as output paths, styles, and scripts.
tsconfig.json:

TypeScript configuration file, specifying compiler options and settings for the TypeScript compiler.
package.json:

Configuration file for Node.js projects. It includes dependencies, scripts, and other metadata about the project. Angular CLI commands are often defined in the scripts section.
tslint.json:

Configuration file for TSLint, a static analysis tool for TypeScript. It defines coding style rules and guidelines.
node_modules:

This folder contains all the dependencies and libraries required for the project. It's typically generated and managed by npm (Node Package Manager).
These files and folders collectively provide the basic structure and configuration for an Angular project. Understanding them is essential for developing and maintaining Angular applications.


3. What is angular.json all about?

The `angular.json` file is a configuration file used by Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) to manage various aspects of an Angular project. It contains settings related to the build process, development server configuration, and other project-related configurations. Here are the key aspects of the `angular.json` file:

a. **Workspace Configuration:**
   - The `projects` section in the `angular.json` file contains configurations for each project within the Angular workspace. A workspace can have multiple projects, but typically, there is one primary project.

   ```json
   "projects": {
     "your-project-name": {
       // Project-specific configuration
     }
   }
   ```

b. **Project Configuration:**
   - Inside the project configuration, you'll find settings for the build, serve, test, and lint processes. This includes options like the source and output paths, asset configurations, and various build and development settings.

   ```json
   "your-project-name": {
     "root": "",
     "sourceRoot": "src",
     "projectType": "application",
     // Other project-specific settings
   }
   ```

c. **Build Configuration:**
   - The `architect` section contains configurations for different commands provided by Angular CLI, such as build, serve, test, and lint. The most commonly used configuration is the `build` configuration, which specifies settings for building the application.

   ```json
   "architect": {
     "build": {
       "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
       // Build options and configurations
     }
   }
   ```

d. **Output Paths:**
   - The `outputPath` property under the `architect.build.options` section specifies the output directory for the build artifacts. This is where the compiled and bundled files will be placed after running the `ng build` command.

   ```json
   "options": {
     "outputPath": "dist/your-project-name",
     // Other build options
   }
   ```

e. **Asset Configuration:**
   - The `assets` property under the `architect.build.options` section allows you to configure asset handling. You can specify which files or directories should be copied to the output directory during the build process.

   ```json
   "assets": [
     "src/favicon.ico",
     "src/assets"
   ]
   ```

f. **Environment Configuration:**
   - The `configurations` section allows you to define different build configurations for different environments (e.g., production, staging). Each configuration can override or extend settings defined in the default `options` section.

   ```json
   "configurations": {
     "production": {
       // Configuration specific to the 'production' environment
     }
   }
   ```

g. **Development Server Configuration:**
   - The `serve` section under `architect` contains configuration options for the development server started by the `ng serve` command.

   ```json
   "architect": {
     "serve": {
       "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server",
       // Serve options and configurations
     }
   }
   ```

h. **Global Configuration:**
   - The `cli` section in `angular.json` contains global configurations for Angular CLI, such as the default schematics collection and package manager settings.

   ```json
   "cli": {
     "defaultCollection": "@schematics/angular",
     "packageManager": "npm"
   }
   ```

Understanding and configuring `angular.json` is essential for managing the build process, development environment, and other project-related settings in an Angular application. Developers often interact with this file to customize the behavior of the Angular CLI commands based on project requirements.

3. What is TypeScript configuration and explain about tsconfig.json?

TypeScript Configuration:
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to help developers write more maintainable and scalable code. To configure the TypeScript compiler and specify various options for a TypeScript project, developers use a file called tsconfig.json. This file is a key part of managing TypeScript projects and ensuring that the compiler behaves according to project requirements.

tsconfig.json:
The tsconfig.json file is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) configuration file used to define the settings and options for the TypeScript compiler (tsc). It is placed in the root of the TypeScript project, and it informs the compiler how to transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript.
Example :
{
    "compileOnSave": false,
    "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "./",
        "outDir": "./dist/out-tsc",
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
        "strict": true,
        "noImplicitOverride": true,
        "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
        "noImplicitReturns": true,
        "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
        "sourceMap": true,
        "declaration": false,
        "downlevelIteration": true,
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "importHelpers": true,
        "target": "ES2022",
        "module": "ES2022",
        "useDefineForClassFields": false,
        "lib": [
            "ES2022",
            "dom"
        ],
        "resolveJsonModule": true,
        "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
    },
    "angularCompilerOptions": {
        "enableI18nLegacyMessageIdFormat": false,
        "strictInjectionParameters": true,
        "strictInputAccessModifiers": true,
        "strictTemplates": true
    }
}

4. What is package.json?

The CLI command ng new creates a package.json file when it creates the new workspace. This package.json is used by all projects in the workspace, including the initial application project that is created by the CLI when it creates the workspace.

Initially, this package.json includes a starter set of packages, some of which are required by Angular and others that support common application scenarios. You add packages to package.json as your application evolves. You may even remove some.

The package.json is organized into two groups of packages:

PACKAGES	DETAILS
Dependencies	Essential to running applications.
DevDependencies	Only necessary to develop and build applications.

The packages listed in the dependencies section of package.json are essential to running applications.

The dependencies section of package.json contains:

PACKAGES	DETAILS
Angular packages	Angular core and optional modules; their package names begin @angular
Support packages	3rd party libraries that must be present for Angular applications to run
Polyfill packages	Polyfills plug gaps in a browser's JavaScript implementation

Angular pacakages  -   "@angular/animations": "^16.2.0",
        "@angular/cdk": "^16.2.11",
        "@angular/common": "^16.2.0",
        "@angular/compiler": "^16.2.0",
        "@angular/core": "^16.2.0",
        "@angular/forms": "^16.2.0",
        "@angular/material": "^16.2.11",

Support pacakges - rxjs , ngrx , bootstrap


The packages listed in the devDependencies section of package.json help you develop the application on your local machine. You don't deploy them with the production application.

To add a new devDependency, use either one of the following commands:

content_copy
npm install --save-dev <package-name>

PACKAGE NAME	DETAILS
@angular-devkit/build-angular
The Angular build tools.
@angular/cli
The Angular CLI tools.
@angular/compiler-cli	The Angular compiler, which is invoked by the Angular CLI's ng build and ng serve commands.
@types/...	TypeScript definition files for 3rd party libraries such as Jasmine and Node.js.
jasmine/...	Packages to support the Jasmine test library.
karma/...	Packages to support the karma test runner.
typescript
The TypeScript language server, including the tsc TypeScript compiler.
